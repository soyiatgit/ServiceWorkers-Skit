Make sure you have node installed on your machine.

Run 'npm install' on the root of the project to install all the dependencies from the package.json

Once npm install runs successfully yu should have a folder named node_modules containing all the dependencies.

Now at the root of the project run: 'npm start'.

This will start a local server on port 8080. Once the server is up, you can browse the app at: localhost:8080/index.html
